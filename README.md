## What the JUCE DJ app is

The JUCE DJ app is an audio playback and audio control program that is written in C++ and is based on the JUCE Framework. 
The application’s main features are importing audio files from the user’s PC into the app’s playlist component. From there, the user can load two audio files into two separate DJ decks and play the audio simultaneously. Mixing of the audio can be done by different sliders and coordinate axis plots which control and amend the sound output from the audio files. The program follows the SOC best-practice and separates its components into different .cpp and .h files. 

Please read the Manual file uploaded for a detailed view into the design of the software and how certain aspects are coded in.

You can also check out the Demo.mp4 video to see what the app actually looks like when its built.
